# Deed Dive AWS Demo Stacks

This repository contains companion code for blog posts on my blog [deepdive.codiply.com](https://deepdive.codiply.com). With [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) you can recreate the AWS resources described in the blog posts by deploying them in your own AWS account.

See [README within the infrastructure folder](./infrastructure/README.md) for how to deploy the stacks.
